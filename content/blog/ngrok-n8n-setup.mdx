## ✅ Result First

Before we dive in, here's what success looks like:  
A **working Telegram node** connected to your local n8n instance via a **stable Ngrok webhook**.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

If you're working with a **local instance of n8n**, you've probably run into this error:

> **"Webhook URL is not accessible from the internet."** ❌

This happens when external services—like Telegram or any API—try to reach your workflow but can't, because your local environment isn't exposed to the web.

This guide provides a simple solution using **Ngrok** to create a **public, stable webhook URL** for your local n8n instance running inside a Docker container.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- 🐳 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running
- 💻 Basic familiarity with Docker and n8n
- 🔧 An n8n Docker setup ready to configure
- 📱 _(Optional)_ A Telegram bot if you're testing the Telegram node

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Create an Ngrok Account

Go to [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up for a free account.  
This allows you to securely expose your local machine to the public web.

![Ngrok Setup](https://ngrok-n8n-setup.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/2-ngrok-installation.png)

Once signed in, you'll land on the **Setup & Installation** section.

### 1.1 — 🖥️ Choose Your Operating System

Select your operating system.  
Here, we've selected **Windows**.

### 1.2 — 💾 Installing Ngrok on Windows

Make sure you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) (`choco`) installed.

Then run:

```bash
choco install ngrok
```

### 1.3 — 🍎 Installing ngrok on Mac

If you are using macOS, you'll need to have Homebrew (brew) installed. If you haven't installed it yet, refer to this quick 2-minute video: [How to install brew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SELYgZvAZbU).

Then, run the command provided on the setup page to install Ngrok via brew:

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

### 1.4 — 🔗 Creating a Static Domain Using Ngrok

Next, create a static domain. This gives you a fixed URL that we will use to access our local n8n instance from the public web.

---

## 🐳 Step 2: Configuring the Docker n8n Instance with the Webhook URL

Now, spin up Docker and start your n8n instance.

### 2.1 — ⚙️ Configure Docker Settings

**Before running the n8n instance, click the dropdown menu for the Optional settings.**
This is where you'll be able to add custom environment variables like your webhook URL.

**Set up the configuration before launching n8n:**

- **🔢 Port Number:** Choose the port you want n8n to run on (default is usually `5678`).
- **💾 Volumes:**
  - **Host Path:** Choose a path on your machine to store n8n data.
  - **Container Path:** Set this to `/home/node/.n8n`
- **🔐 Environment Variables:**

  - **Variable:** `WEBHOOK_URL`
  - **Value:** Your static URL from Ngrok (e.g., `https://yourdomain.ngrok.io`)

Once everything is set, **click the "Run" button** to start the n8n instance.

---

## 🔄 Step 3: Spin Up Ngrok and Test the Telegram n8n Node

### 3.1 — 🔍 Inspect the WEBHOOK_URL Configuration

**Open your local n8n instance in the browser using the port you configured.**
Once inside, open the settings for the **Telegram "onMessage" node** (or any trigger node) and click on the **Webhook URLs** dropdown.

![](https://ngrok-n8n-setup.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/10-n8n-view-the-set-n8n-webhookurl.png)

You should now see the public `WEBHOOK_URL` we configured earlier—this means everything is connected properly! ✅

### 3.2 — 🚀 Start Your Local Ngrok Instance

Now, open a new terminal and start Ngrok with the following command:

```bash
ngrok http --url=your-static-url-from-ngrok 5555
```

![](https://ngrok-n8n-setup.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/11-n8n-spin-up-ngrok.png)

- Replace `your-static-url-from-ngrok` with the static domain you set up on Ngrok.
- Adjust the `5555` to match the port your n8n instance is running on (e.g., `5678`).

This will tunnel your local n8n instance to the internet using the static domain.

### 3.3 — 🎉 Test Your Local Telegram Node

Now test your local telegram node - if everything is configured correctly, you should see it working!

## 🏁 Conclusion

By following this guide, you've successfully configured **Ngrok** to expose your local **n8n** instance to the web, allowing you to receive real-time data from external services like **Telegram**.

With a stable, public webhook URL, your local workflows are now fully connected, ready to handle incoming data without issues! 🎉

This setup is perfect for development and testing, giving you the flexibility to integrate with any service that requires a public-facing endpoint, all while running n8n locally.

Feel free to experiment with different APIs and automate your workflows as needed! 🚀
